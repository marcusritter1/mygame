# TODO:

* task to build executable
* task to build virtualenv from requirements.txt
* how to put background audio for menu
* create a simple map based on tiles using a grid raster.
* figure out how t oput pyinstaller in path and make task executable for all systems, or create a simple .sh/bash script for building a executable of the game...

## map questions:

* how to make isometric tiles, grid, textures? -> LIKE IN ANNO?
* move around map with arrow keys
* tiles in class objects and load in game class
* what happens when screen resolution is changed?
* zoom in and out of map?
* when in fullscreen and the game res is smaller than screen resolution game still scrolls around even it is not necessary...
    * ideally game would also be centered for this scenario.
